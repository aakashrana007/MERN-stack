# MERN-stack

The MERN stack is a popular web development framework that consists of four key technologies:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend of applications.
React: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces on the frontend.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side.

Together, these technologies allow developers to build full-stack web applications using JavaScript from the frontend to the backend.
